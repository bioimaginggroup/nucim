Version 1.0.6: Add check for no observations in colors.in.classes(), small design fixes

Version 1.0.7: Rescale weights in colors.in.classes with intensity method. Weights are rescaled to [0, 1] for more robust results. Change to intensity-based weighting with automatic thresholding als default; old version can be implemented using thresh1=0, thresh2=0.

Version 1.0.8: Workflow vignette revised. Removed bug from spots.combined() when using voxelsize. Thanks to Alexander Rapp, TU Darmstadt.
